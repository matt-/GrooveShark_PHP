         See sample_apps/morg/screen_shots for more
    § option_tags_process now generates root key 'comments' with merged
      values from 'tags'.
    § Removed option_tags_html. HTML entities is a thing of the past.

    * Bugfix: audio & video bitrates sometimes wrong in ASF files from 1.7.6,
    § ASF lyrics now returned under [comments][lyrics] from 1.7.5,

    BMP MODULE
    * Bugfix: Undocumented bugfix between 1.7.3 and 1.7.6,

    DATA_HASH MODULE
    * Bugfix: Filenames not escaped with escapeshellarg() under UNIX.
    * Bugfix: UNIX: head and tail called with -cNNN instead of "-c NNN".

    § Bugfix: gmmktime() instead of mktime().

    ISO MODULE
    § Using gmmktime() instead of mktime().

    GZIP MODULE
    ! Module is a memory hog. Reads entire file into memory. It also
      gzdeflates() it to memory. Will use lots of memory on huge files.
      Please someone rewrite it to work with filepointers and seeking.
    ª info['gzip']['files'] removed. Contains redundant information only.
    ª Replaced ['tar'] key with ['parsed_content']. Module can now parse

    JPEG MODULE
    * Bugfix: Error when php exif support enabled.

    LYRICS MODULE
    § Comments are no longer trimmed.

    MIDI MODULE
    * Bugfix: Fixed bug that reported wrong playing time on some files.

    MP3 MODULE
    ª Module fully working.
    ª Memory caches are reset when scanning new file. Might make analyse

      "--alt-preset cbr n" when scanning more files.
    * Bugfix: added LAME preset guessing for presets 410,420,440,490
      (thanks adminÿlogbud*com)

    * Bugfix: Missing 'lossless' key in RIFF-WAV from 1.7.4.
    § Using gmmktime() instead of mktime().

    SHORTEN MODULE
    * Bugfix: Filenames not escaped with escapeshellarg() under UNIX.

    TAR MODULE
    ª Module rewritten to work with filepointer only. Makes parsing a lot
      faster (will fseek() past data). Also saves a lot of memory, expecially
      with large files.
    ª Added warning for non ASCII filenames, which breaks specification.
    ª info['tar']['files'] removed. Contains redundant information only. Also
      causes problems for non ASCII tar files, as filenames are used as keys
      in PHP arrays.

    XIPH MODULE
    * Bugfix: Error message when padding in FLAC files were used up.

    ZIP MODULE
    § Using gmmktime() instead of mktime().

    PDF files can now be detected, but not parsed/analyzed.
    MSOffice files can now be detected, but not parsed/analyzed.


2.0.0b2: [2004-11-01] Allan Hansen

    GENERAL
    * Bugfixes: Analyzed 3,000 files and compared result with 1.7.2 - several
      minor bugs were fixed. Output of 2.0.0 should match 1.7.2 reasonable well.
    * Bugfix: fail_id3 and fail_ape code never executed.
      Wavpack4 support
      Quicktime/MP3-in-MP4, Apple Lossless support
    ª New encoding_id3v2 option/hack for broken ID3v2 tags
    § Tags are no longer trim()ed.
    § Some ['bits_per_sample'] == 0 removed
    ª New option_analyze - disable to detect format only.
    ª New option_accurate_results - disable to greatly speed up parsing of
      AAC/ADTS, headerless MP3/MP2 VBR, midi (later), possible more in future.
      Warnings issued when disabled and accuracy affected!

    AAC/ADTS
    ª Memory caches destroyed after analyze() to free up memory.

    LA MODULE
    * Bugfix: RIFF tags now parsed properly

    OPTIMFROG MODULE
    * Bugfix: RIFF tags now parsed properly

    WAVPACK MODULE
    * Bugfix: RIFF trailer now parsed properly

    QUICKTIME MODULE
    § option_extra_info determines whether atom_data is returned
    § Removed $ParseAllPossibleAtoms option. We should only return useful data.
      zlib support in PHP optional reqirement
    * Bugfix: New iTunes crashes PHP - temp fix - no tags on those files.

    RIFF MODULE
    * Bugfix: Wavpack3 extra fields now parsed properly.
    § RIFF tags in Litewave files now parsed properly

    BONK MODULE
    * Bugfix: ['bonk']['ID3']['valid'] now returns bool instead of object

    NSV MODULE
    * Bugfix: PCM part ignored

    APETAG MODULE
    * Bugfix: APEtag 1.0 broken

    ASF MODULE
    § Embedded ID3v2 tags processes again - supported by Windows Media Player.

    DEMOS
    ª demo.browse.php scans directories faster with inaccurate results.
    ª demo.browse.php now uses javascript alert to show longer warnings etc
      instead of tool tips.
    ª demo.browse.php now shows embedded covers just like the 1.7.x demo.
    ª demo.browse.dhtml.php - DHTML version of the browser. Has progressive
      display in MSIE - but quite slow when scanning LOTS of files.
    ª New demo.mime_only.php for returning mime type only.
    ª Search example in demo.mysql.php


2.0.0b1: [2004-08-23] Allan Hansen

    ª Major memory savings. 1.7.1 use 25% more memory under PHP 5.0.0 than
      PHP 4.3.7. 2.0.0b1 memory usage is comparable to 1.7.1 under PHP 4.3.7.
      See Memory.xls for details (will not be included in 2.0.0 final).
      Loading all modules requires 4,277 kb of memory (4,171 with iconv()
      support in PHP. Some of the modules  require more memory while scanning,
      as they cache the results - MP3 and AAC/ADTS in particular.

    ª New internal testing method. Output of 2.0.0 matches that of 1.7.1
      exactly - except those places where we deliberately changed something.
      If something is changed it is because we did not have a test file
      to show it.

    ª New extras directory.
      This contains multiple usefull code snips that really does not
      belong to the main getID3() codebase - i.e. stuff that the user most
      likely can/will do differently.

    ª Deleted getid3_lib.php
      - Some common functions moved to getid3.php - getid3_lib declared
        there.
      - Replaygain function moved to getid3.php   - new class
        geti3_replaygain.
      - iconv() replacement function moved to new lib module.
      - md5/sha1 data hash function moved to new lib module.
      - Some function moved to the files that use them.
      - CopyTagsToComments() moved to extras dir.
      - EmbeddedLookup() gone - PHP5 use way more memory that way.

    ª magic_quotes_runtime must be disabled before running getID3().
      If you use them, use set_magic_quotes_runtime(0) and
      set_magic_quotes_runtime(1) around your getID3() block.
      Older versions turned them on and off automatically. This would
      require a lot extra code, since they needed being restored before
      every first level throw.

    * Bugfix: Fixed multiple bugs in the caching extentions .

      Optimized most modules using new getid3_ReadSequence()

      Checked all(most) code using error_reporting (E_STRICT | E_ALL)

    § Removed all dead modules: EXE, RAR, Bink, Matroska, MOD*.
    § Kept magic bytes - getid3 will detect them and do nothing and return
      warning instead of error.

    § Disabled quicktime and mpeg modules as they depend on mp3-

    Reformatted and updated dependencies.txt


    GETID3 MAIN
    § getid3 option_tags_html     now defaults to false.
    § getid3 option_max_2gb_check now defaults to false.
    § New getid3 option_tags_images defaults to false. Scan tags for binary
      image data - ID3v2 and vorbiscomments only. Possible apetag later.


    JPEG MODULE
    § Renamed module from jpg to jpeg.
    § Changed mime type to correct image/jpeg.
    § Added optional exif depency to depencies.txt for jpeg files.


    PNG MODULE
    § Made png zlib dependecy optional.


    BMP MODULE
    ª Removed unused and unneeded PlotBMP() in bmp module.
      Removed extract_palette and extract_data code
      - This does not belong in getid3. We should analyze files, not process
        them.  If the user wants to display bmp files to the browser she can
        convert them with ImageMagick or something similar. She will
        probably have it installed already to resize user uploaded images.


    PCD MODULE
    ª Removed $ExtractData from pcd module - same reason as BMP.


    SWF MODULE
    § Added zlib dependecy REQUIRED for swf.


    ID3v1 MODULE
    §  Removed id3v1 padding check - who cares?
       - also removed in lyrics3 - if needed - it needs to be done differently
       - no access to warnings and no sorting!


    ID3v2 MODULE
    § Made id3v2 zlib dependecy optional.
    § id3v2 - images  - changed 'image_mime' to actual mime type.


    AAC MODULE(s)
    ª Split aac module in two - aac_adif and aac_adts.
      This saves memory if user only have files of one type (very likely).
      Replaced getid3_lib::Bin2Dec() with bindec() in aac modules - speed.


    AC3 MODULE
      Added ac3 optional dependency to dependencies.txt.
    § Changed riff module dependency on mp3 to optional.
      Changed wawpack references in riff module to wavpack3.
    * Bugfix: RIFFparseWavPackHeader() needs 28 bytes, not 22.


    ASF MODULE
    ª Removed id3v1 dependency
    ª Removed id3v2 dependency
    § ASF genres are no longer case adjustet to match standard ID3v1 ones.
    § Embedded ID3v2 tags no longer processes. Not part of the ASF spec.
    § Changed warning at line 71 to error.
    ª Removed a lot of unneeded conversions between Bytestring and GUID
    ª Changed the constants from bytestring to GUID
    * Bugfix: Fixed incorrect warning messages on
      	{4B1ACBE3-100B-11D0-A39B-00A0C90348F6}
      	{4CFEDB20-75F6-11CF-9C0F-00A0C90349CB}
    § Removed objectid, fileid, reserved_1_id and reserved where 'same'_guid
      exists.


    MP3 MODULE
    § MARKED MP3 MODULE BROKEN
      Removed echoerrors debugcode in mp3 module.
      Removed bruteforce code in mp3 module - never executed in 1.7.
      Removed $scan_as_cbr - not used.


    MPC MODULE(s)
    ª Split mpc module in two - SV7 in "mpc" and SV4-6 in mpc_old.
      This saves memory if user only have files of one type (very likely).


    OGG, FLAC MODULES
    ª Merged interdependant modules ogg and flac into new module xiph.
    § Updated FLACapplicationIDLookup() with 2 new entries.


    REAL MODULE
    § Removed 'unknown' keys.


    SHORTEN MODULE
    ª Improved UNIX shorten binary detection. Scanning `which shorten`,
      /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin and checking is_executable()


    ISO MODULE
    § Removed unused_ indexes in iso modules - they are afterall not used.


    DEMOS
    ª Created new index.php in demos/ explaining what the different demos
      does.

    ª Rewrote demo.browse.php completely.
      - Using public domain HTML abstraction library by Allan Hansen.
      - Removed security breach - able to browse any parent directory .
      - A $root_path must be set before browsing.
      - Screen width option.
      - Compressed filename column using title=.
      - Removed filesize column - not really that interesting.
      - Removed md5data column.
      - Removed total at the bottom - the user can probably figure out
        how to implement this himself.
      - Added Audio column: sample_rate/bits_per_sample/channels columns.
      - Added scan_time columns - how long it took getid3 to process the
        file.
      - Compressed artist, title and warning column using tool_tips.
      - Removed delete feature - possible security risk.
      - Repeating file header every 20 rows.
      - Added audio format/video format to format column.
      - Listing supported php modules in footer.
      - New colour scheme.

    ª Rewrote demo.mysql.php completely.
      - Using multiple tables instead of just one. No string is stored
        twice. Searching tags should be a lot faster for large databases.
      - Multiple artists, titles, genres, etc per file supported.
      - Using public domain HTML  abstraction library by Allan Hansen.
      - Using public domain MySQL abstraction library by Allan Hansen.
      - Scanning limited to $audio_path - security.
      - Included sample data that can be imported and browsed.

    ª Rewrote demo.basic.php
    ª Removed demo.simple.php - basic should be enough

    ª Removed demo.joinmp3.php - this advanced demo should go in the extras
      module IF/WHEN the mp3 module is running again.

    § Updated demo.audioinfo.class - minor changes.


    MISC CODING SPECIFIC
      Partial new coding style - some is easily changed with Replace In Files
        - New file header - PEAR compatible
        - Indentation with four spaces instead of tab - PEAR compatible
        - array() changed to as array () - as suggested by PEAR standard
        - All(most) function names in MixedCase
        - Variables in $my_variable lowercase/underscores
        - (bool) $var changed to (bool)$var
        - A few "} else {" changed to "else {" to make room for easier
          readable comments

      Removed all DivByZero checks. The plan was to catch them, but php
      errors and warnings are not exceptions... Something needs to be
      done here.
